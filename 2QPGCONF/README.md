## Abstract:

Leveraging PostgreSQL in Data Science with Python and R

In data science, most of the data intensive processing work can be leveraged with a powerful backend RDBMS such as PostgreSQL. Specifically, with Python Pandas and R connected to Postgres, one can robustly handle data migration, merging, aggregation, concatenation, and even calculation compared to built-in methods at the application layer. Using the Python-Postgres DB-API, psycopg2, interfaced with sqlAlchemy and the R-Postgres DB-API, RPostgreSQL, in the DBI standard, this talk walks through these two open-source stacks using Chicago CTA ridership data. Comparisons drawn between flat file and relational data with benchmarks and profiling will show how data scientists can leverage PostgreSQL's toolkit of indexes, join optimization, materialized views, window functions, and user-defined methods for data processing needs.
